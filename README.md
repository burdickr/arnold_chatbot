### Background
This project will introduce a chat bot which will interact with a user in a learning environment geared towards muscular identification and exerciese.

### Goal
To develop an interactive chat bot which will keep the user engaged in the topic and allow them to learn efficiently and effectively.

### Technologies
We will incorporate machine learning to classify the input questions and return the appropriate answers. We will use NLP to understand all related phrases. The bot will propose further dialog by engaging the user to continue learning more about the classified subject.

### Design
The front-end will consist of an input box to allow the user to type questions. We will have an area with an embedded video and also an area for SVG interaction.
